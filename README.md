# Fundamentals Block Review

For this block review, you have several specifications which need to be completed. You are expected to use full TDD in order to demonstrate your understanding of the questions and of good TDD practices. Good luck!

## Section 1 At-The-Zoo (Array Methods)

For each of these challenges, be sure to use the appropriate array-method, and demonstrate your understanding of TDD.

### 1 - `classifyAnimals`

In the daily life of a zoo keeper, it can often be a hassle keep tracking of all the different animal types in the zoo. Using JavaScript, however, you can help the zoo keeper by implementing a function that can collect all the animals of a specific type into a single array.

Your function should take an array of animal objects and an animal type string, and return a new array of animal objects whose type is the same as the given type.

```js
const animals = [
  { name: 'koala bear', type: 'mammal' },
  { name: 'python', type: 'reptile' },
  { name: 'otter', type: 'mammal' },
  { name: 'eagle', type: 'bird' }
];

classifyAnimals(animals, 'mammal');
// returns [{ name: 'koala bear', type: 'mammal' }, { name: 'otter' , type: 'mammal' }]

classifyAnimals(animals, 'reptile');
// returns [{ name: 'python', type: 'reptile' }]
```

### 2 - `createZooDisplays`

Visitors love the different animals on display but have recently remarked that they'd love a small display so passers-bys can learn a bit more about each of these fascinating critters. Implement a function that creates a zoo sign for each animal you've got on display.

Given an array of animal objects containing `name`, `species` and `nativeRegion` keys, your `createZooDisplays` function should return a new array with the text ( formatted as `My name is <name>, and I am a <species> and I'm originally from <nativeRegion>` ) for each animal.

```js
const animals = [
  {
    name: 'Montgomery',
    species: 'Southern African meerkat',
    nativeRegion: 'Botswana'
  }
];

createZooDisplays(animals); // returns ['My name is Montgomery, and I am a Southern African meerkat and I'm originally from Botswana']
```

```js
const animals = [
  {
    name: 'Montgomery',
    species: 'Southern African meerkat',
    nativeRegion: 'Botswana'
  },
  {
    name: 'Salome',
    species: 'Rattlesnake',
    nativeRegion: 'Argentina'
  }
];

createZooDisplays(animals);
/* returns
['My name is Montgomery, and I am a Southern African meerkat and I'm originally from Botswana',
 'My name is Salome, and I am a Rattlesnake and I'm originally from Argentina']
*/
```

### 3 - `createAnimalTally`

It turns out that classifying the animals isn't enough for the zoo keeper and they'd really like to have an object giving a tally of the different animals in the zoo. Implement a function that takes an array of different animal types and returns a tally object counting each of the different animal types.

```js
createAnimalTally(['tiger']); // returns { tiger: 1 }
createAnimalTally(['tiger', 'parrot', 'parrot']); // returns { tiger: 1, parrot: 2 }
```

Your final test should be using the `ncArk` from the `/data/challenge1-data file` _DO NOT COPY AND PASTE THIS INTO YOUR SPEC FILE - it's huge!_ Be sure to export it properly. It should return the following object:

```js
{ platypus: 69,
  lion: 85,
  seal: 80,
  eagle: 74,
  elephant: 67,
  parrot: 83,
  chimp: 106,
  snake: 83,
  tiger: 71,
  koala: 82 }
```

## Section 2 - Using Closures

### 1 - `generateMultiples`

Write a higher-order function called `generateMultiples`.

Your `generateMultiples` function should:

- take a number ( representing a multiple ) as an argument
- return a new function.

The new function should:

- take a number to determine how long the list of multiples should be
- return an array containing a list of multiples

### For Example:

```js
const makeMultiplesOf10 = generateMultiples(10);
makeMultiplesOf10(0); // []
makeMultiplesOf10(3); // [10, 20, 30]
```

```js
const makeMultiplesOf6 = generateMultiples(6);
makeMultiplesOf6(1); // [6]
makeMultiplesOf6(5); // [6, 12, 18, 24, 30]
```

### 2 - `secureFunc`

Write a higher-order function called `secureFunc`.

It should do the following:

- take an original password (string) and a function as its arguments
- return a new function.

The new function should:

- take a password attempt (string)
- if the password attempt matches the original password then it will return invocation of the original function
- otherwise, the new function will return a message stating: `Sorry your password is incorrect!`

### For example:

```js
const saySecret = () => {
  return 'Hopscotch';
};

const securedSaySecret = secureFunc('nc123@!', saySecret);
securedSaySecret('nc123@!'); // returns 'Hopscotch';
securedSaySecret('oops'); // returns 'Sorry your password is incorrect!';
```

```js
const sum = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

const securedSum = secureFunc('nc123@!', sum);
securedSum('nc123@!', 21, 6); // returns 27
securedSum('oops', 10, 5); // returns 'Sorry your password is incorrect!';
```

### 3 - ADVANCED - `rememberMe`

_This challenge is advanced, if you've reached it, please proceed with the other sections before attempting this_

Write a higher-order function called `rememberMe`, which takes a function as it's only argument.

It should do the following:

- take a function
- return a new function.

The new function should:

- if the new function has not previously been called with those arguments, it should return the output of the original function, but store it in a cache
- if the function has been called with those arguments, it should return the output of the original function **WITHOUT** having to execute the functionality

## Section 3 - OOP Banking App

You are building a mobile banking app for a new tech startup! The CTO of the company wants you to design a `User` class that will have various features enabling a user to interact with their new account.

The CTO's specification for the `User` class is detailed below. Be sure to write tests for each element of behaviour you want from the class.

It must have a `currentBalance` property, which will be a **number** representing amount of pounds, starting at `0`:

```js
const anatUser = new User();
anatUser.currentBalance; // 0;
```

It must have a `pots` property, which will be an **empty object** that will store pots for saving money for specific things.

```js
const anatUser = new User();
anatUser.pots; // {};
```

It must have a `depositMoney` method which will update the the `currentBalance` in pounds:

```js
const anatUser = new User();
anatUser.depositMoney(10.56);
anatUser.currentBalance; // 10.56
anatUser.depositMoney(2.3);
anatUser.currentBalance; // 12.86
```

It must have a `createNewPot` method which will add a new property to the `pots` property with a key for the type of the pot being created and an object containing the `potBalance`:

```js
const anatUser = new User();
anatUser.pots; // {}

anatUser.createNewPot('holiday');
anatUser.pots.holiday;
/** {
   potBalance: 0
 }
**/
anatUser.createNewPot('mortgage_deposit');
anatUser.pots.mortgage_deposit;
/** {
   potBalance: 0
 }
**/
```

It must have an `addToPot()` method which will add money to the `potBalance` of a given pot:

```js
const anatUser = new User();
anatUser.pots; // {}

anatUser.createNewPot('holiday');
anatUser.addToPot('holiday', 10);
anatUser.pots.holiday;
/** {
   potBalance: 10
 }
**/
anatUser.addToPot('holiday', 30);
anatUser.pots.holiday;
/** {
   potBalance: 40
 }
**/
```

It must have a `transferToPot()` method which will transfer money from the `currentBalance` to the `potBalance`. If there is **insufficient money** in the `currentBalance` then the function should have no effect on the current User.

```js
const anatUser = new User();

anatUser.createNewPot('holiday');
anatUser.depositMoney(10);
anatUser.transferToPot('holiday', 5.03);

anatUser.currentBalance; // 4.97
anatUser.pots.holiday;
/*
{
  potBalance: 5.03
}
*/
```

## Section 4 - Recursion

### 1 - `deepKeys`

Implement a function `deepKeys` that will take an object as its argument and go through that object, including any nested objects, and collect all of the keys into a single array.

```js
deepKeys({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }) // ['a','b','c']
deepKeys({ a: 1, b: 2, c: { d: 10 }) // ['a','b','c','d']
deepKeys({ a: 1, b: { e: 10 }, c: { d: 10, e: { f: 100, h: 10 } } }) // [ 'a', 'b', 'e', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'h' ]
```

### 2 - `deepRoute`

Implement a function called `deepRoute`. This function will return a route string representing the route to a given element in a nested array. The format of the route string should be with the index of each nested array separated by an '`->`'. The function should return an empty string in the case where the item is not inside the array.

```js
deepRoute(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'z'); // returns ''
deepRoute(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'a'); // returns '0'
deepRoute(['a', 'b', 'c'], 'c'); // returns '2'
deepRoute(['a', 'b', ['c', 'd'], 'e'], 'c'); // returns '2->0' (2 for the position in the lowest level, 0 in the nested array)
deepRoute(['a', 'b', ['c', ['d'], 'e', 'f']], 'd'); // returns '2->1->0'
```

### 3 - `flat`

Reimplement the experimental array method `flat`. You can find the [docs here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat)
